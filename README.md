## Project Description
The objective of our chat application is to provide an easy, intuitive interface for users to chat with other users. The application is split into two main components, server and client. Users can start communicating by connecting to the chat server via their web browser. Upon accessing the application, users will be greeted with a login page to either login or create an account. Once logged in, users will be displayed a list of existing chat rooms to join. Users have the ability to send text messages, upload and download files. Users can additionally create, join and leave group chats (i.e. rooms) with other users.
